# Movie_Recommender_System

Movie recommendation system that recommends movies based on user input using the KNN algorithm. Movies are recommended based on the genre, cast, and director.




# KNN Algorithm

The K Nearest Neighbor algorithm is classified as supervised learning and is commonly used for classification and regression. It is a versatile algorithm that can also be used to impute missing values and resample datasets. The nearest neighbours are those data points that are the shortest distance away in feature space from our new data point. And K is the number of such data points that we consider in our algorithm implementation. As a result, the distance metric and K value are two critical considerations when employing the KNN algorithm.
